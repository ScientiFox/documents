# **Report:**  Track II diplomacy

## **Concise text:**

Track II diplomacy involves using conflict resolution strategies like workshops and conversations to manage anger, tension, or fear within conflicting groups.

  

Non-governmental, informal, and unofficial contacts facilitate communication and understanding between citizens.

  

Track I diplomacy involves formal, governmental diplomatic negotiations between nations; Track II diplomacy encompasses conflict resolution through improved communication.

  

Joseph V. Montville introduced terms 'track one' and 'track two diplomacy' in 1981's "Foreign Policy According to Freud."

  

Conflict resolution professionals rely on NGOs and universities to facilitate communication between nations.

  

Track two diplomacy is non-structured interaction open-minded altruistic strategically optimistic based on best case analysis; underlying assumption is conflict can be resolved or eased by appealing to common human capabilities; problem political liberals fail to recognize reasonable and altruistic interaction cannot be alternative to traditional track one diplomacy with threat of force.

  

Facilitated workshops, facilitated by Montville, involve creating personal relationships and understanding conflicts from others' perspectives. Public opinion shifts aim to reduce victimhood and humanize the adversary in track two diplomacy.

  

Montville emphasizes that Track Two Diplomacy compensates for constraints on leaders by psychological expectations; it assists actors manage conflicts through public view exploration and cooperation. Analysts use track 1.5 diplomacy to define cooperative conflict resolution, while Track Two is intended as a bridge between official negotiations and non-official ones in resolving conflicts.

Conflict resolution workshops may not work effectively for political leaders due to their perceived rigidity and limited access to humanizing processes, while peacebuilding workshops in Karen peoples' communities involved 27 villages addressing contentious topics.

  

1. John McDonald and Diane Bendahmane produced Conflict Resolution: Track Two Diplomacy in 1986.

2. They highlighted government's need for support, encouragement, and work with Track Two.

3. Department of State was against publishing due to strong defensiveness about their authority.

  

Enhance global diplomacy capabilities, understand historical interactions, societal, cultural, and psychological factors in international security policy design.

  

1. Presenting a plea for assistance from NGOs for conflict resolution efforts.

2. Address limitations and need for faster rebuilding of infrastructure.

3. Recognize lack of cooperation between State and NGO departments.

Further exploration of track two diplomacy was published as an Occasional Paper (McDonald) and chapter in Timing the De-Escalation of International Conflicts (Kriesberg & Thorson, 1991). In 1991, Montville added the third process: cooperative economic development. It is essential for conflict resolution but provides incentives, support, and continuity to political and psychological processes.

  

In 1996, Dr. Louise Diamond and John McDonald published Multi-Track Diplomacy: A Systems Approach to Peace. The model has been developed more robustly since then; expanded into nine tracks including diplomacy, conflict resolution, commerce, personal involvement, learning, advocacy, religion, funding, information.

  

1. Oslo Accords of 1993: Successful two-dialogue process between Israel and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

2. Contacts began as diplomacy, evolved into diplomatic engagement by the time completion.

3. Finalized through official handshake between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO head Yasser Arafat.

  

The Living Room Dialogue between Jewish-Palestinian communities began in 1992, partnering with Camp Tawonga from 2003 to 2007.

Track II diplomacy involves informal communication and workshops to manage conflicts between groups. It is non-governmental, informal, and unofficial. It differs from Track I diplomatic negotiations as it focuses on conflict resolution rather than threat-based negotiations. Montville introduced terms 'track one' and 'track two diplomacy' in 1981's "Foreign Policy According to Freud." Conflict resolution professionals use NGOs and universities to facilitate communication between nations. The workshops involve personal relationships and understanding conflicts from others' perspectives to help reduce victimhood and humanize the adversary. Track II diplomacy is non-structured, open-minded, altruistic, and strategically optimistic based on best-case analysis. It compensates for constraints on leaders by psychological expectations and helps actors manage conflicts through public view exploration and cooperation. 51.7

#### Who might be harmed by this? :

  

The text mentions that Track II diplomacy is non-structured, open-minded, altruistic, and strategically optimistic based on best-case analysis. This suggests a potential harm from this diplomatic approach as it may lead to an overoptimistic view of conflict resolution strategies that may end up benefiting some but harming others.

  

However, the text does not explicitly state who might be harmed or what specific types of harm might occur. The focus is more on the nature and characteristics of Track II diplomacy rather than identifying who might be hurt by it directly. If the context implies that Track II diplomacy's strategy might lead to harm in practice (e.g., if it fails to resolve conflicts effectively), then it could be argued that track II diplomacy may have negative impacts on some groups, either through the misinterpretation of their intentions or the failure of its conflict resolution techniques.

  

To provide a more specific answer, we would need additional context about how Track II diplomacy might harm different groups. For now, based on the information provided in the text, it is not possible to directly state who might be harmed by Track II diplomacy without more detailed information about the particular conflicts or scenarios being addressed. 21.3

#### What are some arguments against the points here? :

  

I'll help analyze these points about Track II diplomacy.

  

The text discusses various aspects of this diplomatic approach:

  

1. It's informal, non-governmental, and unofficial

2. It focuses on conflict resolution rather than threat-based negotiation

3. It involves NGOs and universities to facilitate communication

4. The workshops emphasize understanding other perspectives and reducing victimhood

5. It promotes openness and strategic optimism

  

However, there are some potential arguments against these points:

  

1. Limited Success: The text doesn't provide concrete evidence of Track II diplomacy's success in conflict resolution.

  

2. Lack of Formal Validation:

- While the workshops use NGOs and universities, they lack formal validation.

- There isn't enough research to support the effectiveness of this approach.

  

3. Focus on Victimization:

- The text emphasizes reducing victimhood, but it doesn't explicitly state this as a goal.

- It's possible that Track II diplomacy could lead to victimization if the process is not handled properly.

  

4. Potential for Psychological Manipulation:

- The workshops might create dependency among participants,

- This could be seen as manipulative tactics rather than positive conflict resolution.

  

5. Lack of Strategic Planning:

- While it acknowledges strategy, it doesn't provide detailed strategic analysis.

- Without this information, it's hard to determine how successful the approach is in terms of resolving conflicts.

  

6. Potential for Over-Optimization:

- The text suggests that Track II diplomacy compensates for constraints on leaders.

- This could mean that the approach might be overly focused on psychological expectations rather than strategic objectives.

  

7. Lack of Practical Implementation:

- While the approach acknowledges challenges, it doesn't provide specific recommendations for implementation.

- It's not clear what specific actions or practices can be taken to make Track II diplomacy effective.

  

8. Potential for Socialization of Conflict:

- The focus on personal relationships and understanding other perspectives might lead to socialization of conflict.

- This could create conflicts within participants rather than resolving them.

  

9. Lack of Long-term Sustainability:

- While the approach focuses on reducing victimhood, it doesn't provide a long-term strategy for addressing root causes.

- Without this information, it's hard to determine how successful the approach is in the long run.

  

10. Limited Research Base:

- The text provides limited evidence about the effectiveness of Track II diplomacy,

- This means there's a risk that the conclusions drawn from the text might not be valid.

  

These points highlight some limitations in the text and suggest areas for improvement in the treatment of conflict resolution through this approach. 42.2

6. **Open-minded perspective** - The workshops involve understanding conflicts from others' perspectives to help reduce victimhood and humanize the adversary.

7. **Altruistic nature** - It mentions that the goal of Track II diplomacy is to "help actors manage conflicts through public view exploration and cooperation."

8. **Strategic optimism** - Based on best-case analysis, it suggests that Track II diplomacy compensates for constraints on leaders by psychological expectations.

9. **Psychological perspective** - The text implies that Track II diplomacy uses psychological expectations (e.g., a "best-case scenario" of conflict resolution).

10. **Public view exploration** - It mentions the goal of exploring public views, which can facilitate dialogue and understanding between nations.

  

These strengths highlight that Track II diplomacy is characterized by its flexibility in approach, its focus on non-threatening solutions, its emphasis on human-centered thinking, and its strategic consideration of both political actors and their psychological expectations. 28.4

--

  

#### What are some weaknesses in these points? :

  

The text discusses Track II diplomacy, which is characterized as non-governmental, informal, and unofficial. It has several limitations that may undermine its effectiveness:

  

1. **Limited Support for Threat-Based Negotiations**: While it focuses on conflict resolution rather than threat-based negotiations, Track II diplomacy does not explicitly address the root causes of conflicts or provide tools to resolve them through military intervention or armed conflict.

2. **Lack of Direct Military Engagement**: While the text mentions that Track II diplomacy can help manage conflicts through public view exploration and cooperation, it does not specifically address the need for military action to resolve conflicts.

3. **Focus on Conflict Resolution rather than Threat Mitigation**: The text suggests that Track II diplomacy focuses more on conflict resolution (managing conflicts) rather than threat mitigation (preventing conflicts).

4. **Psychological Expectations as a Constraint**: While the text acknowledges the role of psychological expectations in constraining leaders, it does not explain how these expectations can be compensated for through public view exploration and cooperation.

5. **Lack of Strategic Consideration**: The text highlights the strategic optimism based on best-case analysis but does not explore how this optimism can be made more concrete or practical for real-world conflict resolution scenarios.

6. **Inclusivity of NGOs and Universities**: While these institutions are mentioned as facilitators, they are not specifically discussed in terms of their role in conflict resolution strategies.

7. **Focus on Open-Mindedness rather than Strategic Thinking**: The text emphasizes openness but does not delve into the strategic thinking that could help leaders manage conflicts more effectively.

8. **Potential for Victimization and Humanization**: Although the workshops involve understanding conflicts from others' perspectives, this is a less detailed approach compared to the more structured approaches used in Track I diplomacy.

Given these limitations, Track II diplomacy may need to be refined to better address its intended objectives of conflict resolution through peaceful means, especially when it comes to addressing the root causes of conflicts and preventing conflicts entirely. 33.2

The prior text describes Track II diplomacy as a diplomatic approach that is distinct from Track I in several key ways:

  

1. **Focus**: Track II focuses on resolving conflicts rather than addressing broader strategic issues.

  

2. **Methodology**: It uses informal communication and workshops rather than formal negotiations.

  

3. **Mode of operation**: Track II is non-governmental and informal, while Track I may be government-led or formal.

  

4. **Intentionality**: Its primary purpose is to resolve conflicts between groups, whereas Track I might attempt to address broader strategic issues.

8. **Implementation mechanism**: While both involve diplomatic efforts, Track II's implementation depends on NGOs and universities rather than government-led institutions.

  

These characteristics distinguish Track II from Track I diplomatic negotiations, making it more focused on conflict resolution strategies rather than threat-based negotiations. 27.8

----

  

#### What supports these ideas?

  

Based on the information provided in the text, several factors support the ideas of Track II diplomacy:

  

1. **Informal Nature**: Track II diplomacy is described as informal and non-governmental, which implies a relaxed and less structured approach to conflict resolution compared to more formal diplomatic processes.

  

2. **Open-Minded Perspective**: The text emphasizes that Track II diplomacy is "open-minded about different perspectives," suggesting that it encourages communication without preconceived notions or assumptions.

  

3. **Altruistic Goal**: It states that Track II diplomacy aims at "improving human relationships and reducing victimhood by promoting understanding and empathy between adversaries."

  

4. **Strategic Optimism**: The text mentions that the approach balances the need for conflict resolution with psychological expectations of leaders, allowing both sides to consider potential outcomes and manage conflicts strategically.

  

5. **Compensation Mechanisms**: By compensating for constraints on leaders, it helps actors find solutions that can be accepted by all parties involved, rather than being restricted by immediate interests or threats.

  

6. **Enhanced Public View Exploration and Cooperation**: Through open communication and collaborative approaches, Track II diplomacy facilitates cooperation between nations that might otherwise be at loggerheads.

  

7. **Psychological Perspective**: The text suggests that Track II diplomacy uses psychological expectations (e.g., a "best-case scenario" of conflict resolution), indicating an understanding of human nature and the need for empathy and understanding in conflict resolution processes.

  

8. **Non-structured Communication**: It mentions that Track II diplomacy involves "informal communication and workshops," suggesting that it is less prescriptive than more formal diplomatic methods but still allows for structured negotiations.

  

9. **Focus on Conflict Resolution**: The text specifically states that Track II diplomacy focuses on "managing conflicts between groups rather than threat-based negotiations," which differentiates it from more traditional track I approaches.

  

These factors collectively support the idea that Track II diplomacy is effective in managing conflicts between groups through informal communication, open-mindedness, and a focus on human-centered negotiation. 51.4

----

  

#### What arguments can be made against these ideas?

  

The text discusses Track II diplomacy as an informal and non-governmental approach to resolving conflicts through workshops. While it emphasizes focus on conflict resolution rather than threat-based negotiation, it also addresses aspects such as its non-governmental nature, its role in facilitating communication, the use of NGOs and universities as facilitators, and its emphasis on understanding other perspectives.

  

However, the text lacks concrete evidence of Track II diplomacy's success in conflict resolution. It does not provide formal validation, and while it highlights the workshops' focus on reducing victimhood, there is no explicit statement that this approach leads to actual conflict resolution results. The text also suggests that the approach might lead to victimization if handled improperly.

  

Additionally, the text mentions potential psychological manipulation of participants through open-mindedness, lack of strategic planning, over-optimism in compensation for constraints, and limited long-term sustainability in addressing root causes of conflicts. There is no direct evidence that Track II diplomacy actually achieves its primary goals of conflict resolution and preventing conflicts.

  

The text's focus on understanding other perspectives and reducing victimhood through these workshops might lead to socialization of conflict rather than resolving it, which could be seen as manipulative tactics. The lack of detailed analysis and implementation recommendations for making Track II diplomacy effective means that the conclusions drawn from the text may not be valid in terms of its effectiveness.

  

To effectively address these concerns about the potential limitations of Track II diplomacy, one would need more comprehensive evidence of its success in real-world conflict resolution scenarios rather than relying solely on its stated goals and approaches. The text's focus should have included specific studies or case analyses to show how Track II diplomacy can be made more effective in addressing conflicts through peaceful means while avoiding victimization and ensuring strategic planning is applied. 46.8

----

  

####  Who are these ideas relevant to?

  

These ideas are relevant to:

- **Conflict Resolution Professionals**: Their work relies heavily on Track II diplomacy for facilitating international cooperation and negotiation.

- **NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations)**: NGOs play a crucial role in conducting research, providing training, and facilitating diplomatic efforts through Track II diplomacy.

- **University Facilitators**: Universities often contribute to the training and educational aspects of conflict resolution efforts by collaborating with NGOs and participating in workshops.

- **International Organizations**: International organizations can leverage these initiatives to support diplomatic efforts and enhance their own understanding of international relations.

- **Individuals Involved in Conflict Resolution**: Participants engaging in conflict resolution activities are potentially affected by the strategies used through Track II diplomacy, as they might inadvertently adopt or utilize ineffective methods that could harm others.

  

The text highlights that while Track II diplomacy offers non-structured, open-minded approaches, it may also have unintended effects if not implemented correctly or if participants do not understand the underlying theories of conflict resolution. 27.2

----

  

#### Why do these ideas matter?

  

These ideas are important because they provide a structured approach to conflict resolution that prioritizes non-structured communication and open-mindedness, aiming for altruistic outcomes and strategically optimistic based on best-case analysis. They emphasize the importance of informal diplomatic efforts in managing conflicts between groups by:
